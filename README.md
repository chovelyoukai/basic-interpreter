# Basic Interpreter

This is a simple interpreter for a dialect of "BASIC." It was built loosely
following the great tutorials at https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/, but
quickly diverged after the simple calculator functionality was finished.

A formal description of the syntax of the language this interpreter implements
can be found in `basic_syntax`. Example programs can be found in the
`basic_examples` subdirectory.

## Building

To build, run `javac *.java`
